# 🌐 Website

My personal website powered by [Astro](https://astro.build), with a focus on performance, scalability, and expressive UI animation using GSAP and Three.js.
It runs on an [Express](https://expressjs.com/) server with security middleware like Helmet and supports compression out of the box.
